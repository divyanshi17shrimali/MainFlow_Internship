# MainFlow_Internship
This repository contains the python codes of the task assigned by the MainFlow company during this Internship period.
Task 1: Understanding Python Data Types
Description: This task involves understanding the basic data types in Python such as lists, dictionaries, and sets.
Responsibility: Write a Python program to create a list, a dictionary, and a set. Perform basic operations like adding, removing, and modifying elements.
Task 2: Data Preprocessing and Cleaning
Successfully completed Task 2 of the data preprocessing and cleaning assignment. Gained practical experience in cleaning datasets, handling missing values, and removing outliers. Enhanced my skills in transforming raw data into a usable format.
Task 3: Create a bar chart, a line chart, histograms, scatter plot using Matplotlib to visualize data from a Pandas DataFrame. Customize the charts with labels, titles, and legends.
Task 4: This task involves performing exploratory data analysis on a dataset. Create visualizations to understand the distribution of variables, identify outliers, and check for correlations between variables.
Task 5: Analyzed a heart disease dataset using Python libraries including Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn. Explored heart disease prevalence, gender differences, chest pain types, age distribution, and maximum heart rate. Highlights the role of data visualization in extracting healthcare insights.
